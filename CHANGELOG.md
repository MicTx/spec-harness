# Changelog

This file records user-visible behavior changes. For a detailed design or recovery story, follow the linked documentation; do not infer a new command or guarantee from a changelog bullet alone.

All notable user-facing changes to Spec Harness are recorded here. Internal development records are kept separately from the public documentation.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.12] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- The push closeout now accepts the `archive/retired/YYYY-MM-DD/` containers the organize command creates as historical paths: they no longer fail record-slug validation or the archived-bundle scan, so an organize round followed by push closes cleanly.

## [0.13.11] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Added a reader introduction and a hands-on long-running task tutorial for AI learners, programmers, Agent developers, and long-running task developers.

### Changed

- Package checks reuse a cached scan of archived development records, so repeated gates finish almost instantly instead of rescanning every archive each run.
- The push closeout runs the repository gate once and sorts its findings, instead of repeating the same full check twice.
- Trimmed the skill entry document and reference guides down to rules that name their triggering stage, and folded the former operating-rules page into the remaining guides.
- The team-loop slot leaves batch fan-out and review-fix loops to the workflow-runner slot, so a batch request no longer routes twice.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy protocol import and task-id migration tools from the runtime package; protocol migrations never rewrite historical archives.

## [0.13.10] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Added public Git documentation covering clone, branches, commits, pull requests, releases, and troubleshooting.
- Added public support, security, CODEOWNERS, Issue, and pull-request guidance.

### Changed

- Made the public release guide user-focused and removed private development infrastructure from reader-facing documentation.
- Added public-source metadata, GitHub community files, and documentation link checks.

## [0.13.9] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Added the workflow-runner slot for bounded repository-owned fan-out execution.
- Added runtime package, plugin, and public-source export checks.

### Changed

- Renamed the distributable project to Spec Harness (spec-harness) while keeping spec as the compatible skill and command name.
- Included slots in runtime verification and release validation.

### Fixed

- Hardened output paths, task identifiers, cache files, symlink handling, process timeouts, and corrupted-input handling.
- Improved task-package lifecycle checks, archive recovery, and concurrent state updates.

## [0.13.8] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Consolidated workflow execution around the repository-owned runner and documented the current zero-host engine policy.
- Improved task-package routing, validation, and completion summaries.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- Refined installer host selection, runtime layout checks, and server-mode boundaries.
- Improved Git closeout checks and task-package evidence handling.

## Versioning

Spec Harness follows Semantic Versioning. Patch releases contain documentation, metadata, verification, and backward-compatible fixes. Minor releases add backward-compatible capabilities. Changes to command aliases, task-package formats, exported layouts, or behavior contracts require an explicit compatibility note.
